    <h1> About the project </h1>

     <p> The group prepared for the active use of semantic tags by using an array of sources such as W3Schools and CodeAcademy,
            in order to properly grasp the proper usage of these elements. In addition, we used presentations from the 
            lectures to guide our decion making when in doubt. </p>

    <p> Elements "Strong and "Bold": We decided to mainly use the element "Strong" over the "Bold" tag, due to it working better for both programmer and user. 
        More specifically, we thought the functions included in the "Strong" element, such as its effect on screen reading, would 
        prove beneficial to the user, as opposed to the properties found in the "Bold" element. 
        As a result, if and when the "Bold" element is used, the context is different than for the cases where the "Strong" element is used. 
        In order to to reap the benefits of these tags, we actively used them in relevant literary contexts.</p>

     <p> Semantic elements such as header, navigation and footer were used to section off parts of the page to create more of a well arranged website for the user.
            This is also an essential function for the programmer, as it creates an overview of different relevant elements. </p>
