    <h1><Strong>About the project</Strong></h1>

    <h2> Preparation </h2>
        <p> The group prepared for the active use of semantic tags by using an array of sources such as W3Schools and CodeAcademy,
            in order to properly grasp the proper usage of these elements. In addition, we used presentations from the 
            lectures to guide our decion making when in doubt. </p>
    
    
    <h2> Semantic elements </h2>
        <p> For our code we decided to use a mix of "div" tags and "semantic" tags to emphasize certain sections. This made it easier 
            to keep an overview of each part, especially when using an external CSS sheet. 
        For the specific semantic elements we used header, navigation and footer to section off parts of the page to create 
        more of a well arranged website for the user. This is also an essential function for the programmer, as it creates 
        an overview of different relevant elements. </p>
    
    <h2> Strong and bold, HTML</h2>
         <p>  We decided to mainly use the HTML-element "Strong" over the "Bold" tag, due to it working better for both programmer and user. 
        More specifically, we thought the functions included in the "Strong" element, such as its effect on screen reading, would 
        prove beneficial to the user, as opposed to the properties found in the "Bold" element. 
        As a result, if and when the "Bold" element is used, the context is different than for the cases where the "Strong" element is used. 
        In order to to reap the benefits of these tags, we actively used them in relevant literary contexts.</p>

    
    <h2> Content </h2>
            <p>For the whole page we had focus on readability. For the Background we chose a simple graphic photo in neautral colors. 
            The reason for this being to have something visual for the reader to lay their eyes on, but still make sure that it didn´t interfere with the readability.
            The navigation bar consists of a readable, large font: Verdana. The group intended to create interactive buttons in the navigation bar, 
            but unfortunately we were inhibited by the time constraints. In later obligatory assignments, we intend to give ourselves
            more time in order to incorporate more elements such as this. 
            
            The frontpage aims to centralize the most important information and putting it first, and then adding more information under. When the reader first arrives on the 
            Personal page, i´ts important that they can accsess the most important information first.
            For the portfolio we decided to align the projects horizontally with title over and informational text under. The purpose being to categorize and keep a 
            clear understanding of what belongs to what.
            The resume is clearly sectioned by using a strong-tag for the titles and bulletpoints.
