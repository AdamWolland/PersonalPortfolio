    <h1> About the project </h1>

    <p> A short report of the preparations you did
        beforehand to ensure you would use different semantic tags. Explain why you decided
        to include the different parts of your contents and discuss why the HTML elements
        you used to annotate them were the best option.
        </p>

        <p> The group prepared for the active use of semantic tags by using an array of sources such as W3Schools and CodeAcademy,
            in order to properly grasp the proper usage of these elements. In addition, we used the presentations from the 
            lectures to guide our decion making when in doubt. 

    <p> We decided to mainly use the semantic tag "Strong" over the "Bold" tag, due to it working better for both programmer and user. 
        If and when the "Bold" tag is used, the context is different than for the cases where the "Strong" tag is used.</p>
