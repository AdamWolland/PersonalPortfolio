    <h1>Welcome to my personal page!</h1>
    <p>My name is Mike Oxlong. The last few years, I've gained experience with different softwares utilized for design, and programming, through my Master's degree in graphic design. 
        As an employer you can expect the following: Hard work, working with a passion, a fun guy, an enforcer in the office, and a good coworker. I have lots of experience working with projects, 
        some of which can be viewed under my Portfolio page above. </p>
